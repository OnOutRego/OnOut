# OnOut
# __Development Contribution Guidelines__
The purpose of this post is to begin the creation of guidelines to allow developers to contribute to the OnOut Rego project. 
Select Work
Before beginning development efforts, Devs should check into the [Project Management System Link] to select a user story or bug to work on. They should assign the story to themselves and mark the story as 'Begun/Implementing/etc'

## Branch Creation
Once work selection is done, Developers should create a new branch from the __Dev__ branch with naming style: `[Story/Issue Number] - [Story Title]` ie: `22838-Kennel Repository` or `Bug 22897 - Kennel Features`

## Completion of Work
Once the story or bug is complete, the story should be marked 'Reviewing' and a Pull Request should be submitted to merge the user branch back into the __Dev__ branch. 
Upon completion of automated testing suite, the first prerequisite of an approved PR is a pass of the tests
